          <p>Confused about credit? You're not alone. Credit is the ability to borrow money or access goods with the understanding you'll pay later.
            Your credit score affects a lot of different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Rental and Mortgage Applications</li>
              <p>Looking for an apartment? Awesome! Most landlords whether they are an individual or a large company will check your credit. 
                Your credit history makes up more than a third of your score. 
                This is why some places will ask for a cosigner. A lack of credit means you won’t have much credit history. This makes most landlords nervous, because it means they then don’t have a means to assess your ability to pay.</p>
              <li>Internet</li>
              <p>Need Wifi? Cool! All internet providers in the United States pull your credit report.
                 If your credit report is less than perfect, don’t fret, this won’t necessarily disqualify you from getting service. 
                 However, you may have to pay more money up front.</p>
