    <h1>Budgeting</h1>
    <p>You. Need. A. Budget. It is incredibly important. Whether you have a little income or a lot, managing your finances is extremely important.
      Thankfully in a day and age that's so connected, there are more resources than ever. Apps like YNAB(You need a budget) and Mint allow you set custom savings goals and link bank account to ensure you're on track.
      If you don't want to go that route, excel and google sheets have budget based templates to help you get started.
