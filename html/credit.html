        <H1>Credit: All you need to know</H1>
        <div>
          <p>Confused about credit? You're not alone. Credit is the ability to borrow money or access goods with the understanding you'll pay later.
            Your credit score affects a lot of different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:
            <ol>
              <li><h2>Rental and Mortgage Applications</h2>
              <p>Looking for an apartment? Awesome! Most landlords whether they are an individual or a large company will check your credit. 
                Your credit history makes up more than a third of your score. 
                This is why some places will ask for a cosigner. A lack of credit means you wonâ€™t have much credit history. This makes most landlords nervous, because it means that they then do not have a means to assess your ability to pay.</p></li>
              <li><h2>Internet</h2>
              <p>Need Wifi? Cool! All internet providers in the United States pull your credit report.
                 If your credit report is less than perfect, do not fret, this will not necessarily disqualify you from getting service. 
                 However, you may have to pay more money up front.</p></li> 

              <li><h2>Buying a Vehicle</h2>
                Looking at cars? WAIT! Check that interest rate before you sign on the dotted line.
                Predatory dealerships will try to hook you in with a low downpayment and high interest rate. You could end up paying twice the actual price of the car. </li>
            </ol>
